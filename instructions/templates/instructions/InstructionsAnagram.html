        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>
                You have been placed in a team of <span style="color:red;">[sample size]</span> members, and every team member including you is able
                to communicate with a certain number of other members called neighbors, also participating in this
                exercise. The objective is to form as many words as possible as a group. Words that have been formed by
                every member of the group will appear in the screen before you. You may also request letters from your
                neighbors. Your payout will be based on the performance of the entire team (that is, all individuals). You
                will be able to submit a single word only once, but duplicate words are allowed within the team. Your
                teamâ€™s reward/payment will increase as the number of words submitted by multiple team members
                increases. For example, if Player A submits the word "bag," then the team benefits more by Player B
                submitting "bag" than if Player B submits "gab."
            </p>

            <p>
                You will interact only with your neighbors, but all members of the team are playing the same game, using
                the same directions. You and your neighbors that you interact with is your <b><i>neighborhood</i></b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your neighborhood will be provided with tiles, with a letter written on each tile. Your neighborhood has
                to form as many words with at least 3 letters as you can with these letters in <span style="color:red;">[4]</span> minutes. The money you
                earn will depend on the number of words found by the entire team. If your neighborhood finds <span style="color:red;">[12]</span>
                words, your neighborhood will earn <span style="color:red;">$12</span> (which will be divided equally among the members of the entire
                team). For each additional word (beyond <span style="color:red;">12</span>) your neighborhood finds, the group will receive an extra <span style="color:red;">$1</span>
                that will be also divided equally among all the members of the entire team. So, the greater the number of
                words your neighborhood finds, the more money everyone on the team will make.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout the game you will most likely receive requests for letters from your neighbors. When a
                request is made, you have the ability to copy your letter and pass it to your neighbor. Likewise, you have
                the ability to ask your neighbor to copy letters for you in order to form words. There is no penalty for
                copying letters, but this operation can only be performed <span style="color:red;">[X]</span> times per letter that you choose to share.
            </p>

            <p>
                For constructed words, proper names are not allowed. Plurals are allowed. Verbal conjugation is allowed.
