            <p>
                The final phase of the project is the most detailed. Your team now has the opportunity to earn an
                additional sum of money on top of the results of the first two games. Two teams will be selected, and an
                additional amount of money, <span style="color:red">$[xx]</span>, will be given to one of the teams at random. This will be called the
                <b><i>offeror team</i></b>. The offeror team will be given the opportunity to then communicate among themselves and
                determine how much, if any, of this money that they would like to give to the other team, <b><i>the responder</i></b>
                team. Communication works as it did in phase 1 among neighbors within the team. Initially, every
                member of your team will determine a percentage to offer. Then, you and all members of the team will
                view their neighbors’ offer choices and provide feedback on whether or not you think that you neighbors
                should raise or lower their offer. Meanwhile, the responder team will be communicating using the same
                mechanism to determine the minimum percentage level that they are willing to accept. After a set amount
                of time, <span style="color:red">[5]</span> minutes, each member of each team must vote for the percentage they would like to see
                offered or received. Consensus will be assumed to be the simple average of all of the responses. This
                process may be repeated so that your team can interact multiple times to try to establish a consensus
                choice.
            </p>

            <p>
                The outcome will be determined based on the average thresholds of each group. If the offeror team offers
                a higher or equal percentage than the responder team, the transaction is made and both sides receive the
                requisite additional income. If, however, the offeror team’s percentage is lower than the responder
                group’s threshold, the deal does not occur and both sides forfeit the money; that is, both teams receive
                nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b><i>Example.</i></b><br/>
                Assume that the offeror team receives $20 additional funds in phase 3. After 5 minutes, the group can
                each adjust the percentage that they think should be given to the other team. However, after the 5 minutes,
                each member of the team must vote. Let’s say the average of the votes is 10% of the additional funds
                should be offered to the responder team, or $2.
            </p>

            <p>
                The responder team will have meanwhile deliberated in the same way:
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Case 1</b>. If their minimum percentage average of the responder team is 12%, the deal will <b><i>not</i></b> go through,
                because 10% &lt; 12%. The responder team wants a higher percentage than the offeror team is willing to
                give.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Case 2</b>. If their minimum percentage average is 8%, the deal will go through and the offeror team <b><i>will</i></b>
                receive $18 to distribute amongst the offeror team, and the responder team will receive $2 to split
                amongst its team members.
            </p>

            <p>
                All choices, once made are final. The next screen will give a few examples to illustrate this process.
